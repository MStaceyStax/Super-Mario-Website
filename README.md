Tech Stack
VS Code  
HTML & CSS

Process 
I started by gathering my images in PNG and JPG form and started building the banner of which is the top of the website. Understanding the layout of the website is just as important and the code being used to created it. I made the website responsive. This allows for the website to be viewed on any device. I continued to style the website accordingly with CSS and enjoyed this process thoroughly as I took straight forward design elements into account after applying this the whole UI of the website comes across as user-friendly and appealing. For the website to be just as expressive in apprearance, navigating and including larger images and buttons was a must. Understaing what I built is important and it allows me to put my best foot forward. 

Lessons Learnt 
What I learnt was that it is important to work out your workflow, specially in web development in order to produce awesome projects. 


Overall Improvement 
Learning the basics will only get thus far, but do research to include more complex code if it will work for you and challenge yourself. There is nothing wrong with experienting.
