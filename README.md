   A Super Mario Website

💭 Project - A static Super Mario Website created after learning HTML & CSS

🎨 Features - Displaying the use of what I learnt and concepts put together to show off my understanding and the use of the additional programming lanaguages

📦 Tech Stack - VS Code;  HTML & CSS

✏️ Process - I started by gathering my images in PNG and JPG form and started building the banner of which is the top of the website. Understanding the layout of the website is just as important and the code being used to created it. I made the website responsive. This       allows for the website to be viewed on any device. I continued to style the website accordingly with CSS and enjoyed this process thoroughly as I took straight forward design elements into account after applying this the whole UI of the website comes across as user-        friendly and appealing. For the website to be just as expressive in apprearance, navigating and including larger images and buttons was a must. Understaing what I built is important and it allows me to put my best foot forward. 

🧠 Lessons Learnt - What I learnt was that it is important to work out your workflow, specially in web development in order to produce awesome projects. 

🔍 Areas of Improvement - Learning intemediate and more advanced HTML and CSS code inorder to link to other pages. 

📈 Overall Growth - Learning the basics will only get you thus far, but do research to include more complex code if it will help improve your work and code. This helps challenging me. There is nothing wrong with experienting.
